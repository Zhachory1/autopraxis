# PR Review

Review a pull request against real intent, not guesswork. Produce prioritized, actionable feedback and preserve human accountability for merge.

## Core Principles

**Intent anchors review.** Gather ticket, PRD/DD, issue, roadmap goal, and author notes before judging code.

**Architecture before nits.** Check boundaries, coupling, abstractions, and scope creep before line-level style.

**Findings need evidence.** Blocking comments require file/line, behavior, risk, and suggested fix.

**Re-review the delta.** After author changes, focus on modified code and unresolved findings.

**Human owns merge.** Agent review informs, but does not auto-approve final accountability.

## Inputs

- PR URL, branch, diff, or patch.
- ticket/design docs and acceptance criteria.
- repo context and test commands.
- prior review comments and author responses.
- optional local validation budget.
- run id for `run-telemetry`.

## Tool Awareness

Use `grounding-brief` with code RAG for impacted paths, long-term memory MCP for prior decisions, git/gh for PR metadata and diff, CI status for validation, and agent-fleet council when review stakes are high. Use `council-review` only for conflicting or high-risk calls; do not turn every PR into a council.

## Council Policy

Use `../council-review/references/escalation-matrix.md`. Most PRs should use no council. Use `single-lens` for one domain concern; use minimal/full council only for high-stakes architecture, safety, ML/statistical, security/privacy/reliability, or conflicting reviewer judgments.

## Execution

**Gather context.** Use `grounding-brief` to understand intent, scope, changed files, related docs, tests, CI, and prior comments.

**Architecture check.** Judge layer placement, boundaries, abstractions, coupling, data contracts, rollout, observability, and scope creep.

**Deep dive.** Inspect correctness, edge cases, error handling, security, performance, concurrency, data migrations, tests, docs, and maintainability.

**Local test when useful.** Run focused tests or static checks if feasible, cheap, documented, and relevant. Do not run destructive or broad expensive commands without approval.

**Construct feedback.** Prioritize blockers, majors, minors, and nits. Make every comment actionable.

**Author loop.** After revisions, re-review only changed files, unresolved findings, and newly introduced risk. Bound iterations.

**Human signoff.** Use `handoff-packaging` and `human-approval-gate` for final merge recommendation.

**Emit telemetry.** Use `run-telemetry` for changed file count, findings, blocker count, local validation, iterations, human edits, and outcome.

## Loop Controls

**Author revision loop.** Feedback, author revises, delta re-review until approve, block, or iteration cap.

**Block escalation.** If same blocker persists after cap, escalate with exact unresolved issue and risk.

**Delta-only review.** Do not re-litigate settled files unless new changes touch them.

**Council escalation.** Use `../council-review/references/escalation-matrix.md`; record skipped reason for ordinary PRs, one lens for a single domain concern, and minimal/full council only for high-stakes or conflicting judgments.

## Output Contract

```markdown
# PR Review

## Context
- PR:
- intent:
- scope:
- docs/tickets:
- CI status:

## Verdict
- status: approve | approve-with-nits | request-changes | block | needs-info
- confidence:
- human recommendation:

## Findings
- severity: blocker | major | minor | nit
  file/line:
  claim:
  evidence:
  risk:
  suggested fix:
  blocks merge: yes | no

## Validation
- command/source:
  result:
  caveat:

## Delta Re-Review State
- unresolved:
- settled:
- only re-review next:
- telemetry path:
```

## Success Criteria

- review states intent and scope.
- architecture fit is checked before line-level findings.
- blockers have evidence and suggested fix.
- optional local tests are run only when useful and safe.
- revision loop is bounded and delta-only.
- final human approval package exists for merge.
- `run-telemetry` event emitted.

## Common Failure Modes

**Review without context.** Fix by requiring grounding brief sources.

**Nit flood.** Fix by prioritizing blockers and majors; nits only when cheap and useful.

**Static-only confidence.** Fix by running focused validation when feasible.

**Autopilot approval.** Fix by routing final merge to `human-approval-gate`.

## Self-Improvement

Track missed defects, false blockers, author edit rate, re-review churn, and human overrides. Feed trends into `backprop` to improve review rubrics, council escalation rules, and test-selection heuristics.

# Handoff Packaging

Create a standard artifact bundle that makes workflow output consumable by the next agent, reviewer, approver, or operator.

## Core Principles

**Handoff transfers accountability context.** Include what was done, why, evidence, known limits, and what remains.

**Evidence beats narrative.** Link tests, metrics, logs, model artifacts, council verdicts, PR diffs, and source docs.

**Limitations are part of the output.** Hidden caveats become downstream failures.

**Next action must be obvious.** The recipient should know whether to review, approve, deploy, continue, or stop.

**Telemetry travels with work.** Include `run-telemetry` summary so `backprop` can evaluate workflow health.

## Inputs

- workflow name and run id.
- grounding brief and source artifacts.
- docs, plans, PRs, diffs, models, notebooks, logs, dashboards, council outputs.
- validation results and success metrics.
- known limitations and open questions.
- target recipient and requested decision.

## Execution

**Summarize outcome.** State what changed or was learned in one short paragraph.

**Attach evidence.** Link exact files, commits, PRs, tests, metrics, council transcripts, experiment artifacts, RCA evidence.

**State decisions.** List key choices, alternatives rejected, and owner.

**Expose limitations.** Record caveats, unresolved risks, data constraints, rollout risks, and follow-ups.

**Package next action.** Route to `human-approval-gate`, `ship`, launch PR, deployment, roadmap owner, or further investigation.

**Emit telemetry.** Record package completeness, artifact count, validation state, open-risk count, and handoff recipient via `run-telemetry`.

## Output Contract

```markdown
# Handoff Package

## Summary
- workflow:
- run id:
- outcome:
- recommendation:

## Evidence
- artifact:
  type:
  pointer:
  result:

## Decisions
- decision:
  rationale:
  owner:
  source:

## Validation
- check:
  command/source:
  result:
  caveat:

## Known Limitations
- limitation:
  impact:
  mitigation or owner:

## Telemetry Summary
- latency:
- cost/tokens:
- loop count:
- escalations:
- human edits:

## Next Action
- ask:
- owner:
- deadline:
- approval gate:
```

## Workflow Uses

- `dev-workflow`: launch PR package with docs, rationale, tests, council verdicts.
- `ml-experiments`: model/code/data lineage/metrics bundle for deployment or further research.
- `debug-investigation`: RCA, fix evidence, prevention actions.
- `project-ideation`: framed candidate for roadmap scoring.
- `roadmapping`: approval packet with tradeoffs and capacity assumptions.
- `backprop`: proposed workflow change, measured cause, A/B result, changelog.

## Success Criteria

- recipient can act without re-reading full transcript.
- every evidence claim has pointer.
- limitations and open questions are explicit.
- next decision and owner are clear.
- `run-telemetry` event emitted.

## Common Failure Modes

**Victory lap without caveats.** Fix by requiring known limitations.

**Artifact soup.** Fix by tagging each artifact with purpose and result.

**Missing decision ask.** Fix by routing to `human-approval-gate` with exact yes/no.

**Telemetry dropped.** Fix by including run summary or stating unavailable fields.

## Self-Improvement

Track handoffs that caused recipient confusion, missing evidence requests, or rework. Feed patterns into `backprop` to improve package fields and required artifacts.

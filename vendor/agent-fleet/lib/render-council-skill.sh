description: "Convene a council of 3-6 specialist personas to review a high-stakes decision (model change, experiment readout, design doc, serving-path PR, architecture/build-vs-buy). Supports --mode ship|research|domain|exec|minimal and forced --personas rosters. Picks personas, runs a bounded debate, synthesizes a decision-grade answer with named dissents. Triggers /council, council review, get a second opinion, tear this apart, is this safe to ship, review this model/experiment/design."
